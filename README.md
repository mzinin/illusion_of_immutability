# Illusion of Immutability
This repo contains all code samples for "Illusion of Immutability" article.

# Prerequisites

Code is tested to be compiled and/or run on Ubuntu 18.04. It requires:

    POSIX-compliant OS (tested only on Linux)
    Bash shell
    C++ compiler with C++11 support
    JDK >= 8 (that's the minimal tested version)
    Python 3
    Golang >= 1.10 (minimal tested version)
    Erlang >= 20.2 (minimal tested version)

# Build and run

Every language specific folder contains `run.sh` shell script. Every compiled language specific folder also contains `build.sh` and `clean.sh` scripts. I believe these scripts' names are quite self-explanatory.
